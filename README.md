# Artist Management System

## Getting Started

This project consists of a server (backend) and a client (frontend) that interact with a MySQL database. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

### Database Setup (MySQL)

To set up the MySQL database required for the project, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to your MySQL database server.**

2. **Run the following SQL commands to create the database and tables:**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE  artist_management;

   USE artist_management;

   CREATE TABLE  user (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       password VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
       phone VARCHAR(20),
       dob DATE,
       gender ENUM('m', 'f', 'o') NOT NULL,
       address VARCHAR(255),
       role ENUM('super_admin', 'artist_manager', 'artist') NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   CREATE TABLE  artist (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       dob DATE,
       gender ENUM('m', 'f', 'o'),
       address VARCHAR(255),
       first_release_year INT,
       no_of_albums_released INT,
       user_id INT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   CREATE TABLE  song (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       album_name VARCHAR(255),
       genre ENUM('rnb', 'country', 'classic', 'rock', 'jazz') NOT NULL,
       artist_id INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artist(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );


   ```

### Important Note on Artist Table

In the `artist` table, I have added a `user_id` field. This field establishes a relationship between an artist and a user account in the system. When an User with role artist is logged in, we can display songs associated with that artist by using their `user_id`. This design allows for efficient management of songs, enabling users to add, delete, or edit songs linked to their respective artist profiles seamlessly.

### Running the Server (Backend)

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` File:**

   Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Open the `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables. This typically includes database connection details and any other sensitive configuration required for the backend.

4. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will run the backend server in development mode.

### Running the Client (Frontend)

1. **Navigate to the Client Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Client:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the React frontend in development mode.

Now, youâ€™re ready to run the full stack of the Artist Management System!

Start both the client and server, and the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

Ensure your MySQL database is running and properly configured to avoid any connection issues.
